# WORLD MAP FANTASY

## Intro

This application is inspired by my trip from winter break, when I visited my 
sister in Finland and went on an EU trip with her to 7 countries in a week. After my trip,
I thought it would be cool to have an app that tracks all the places that I set foot on.
But as such apps do exist in App Store (i.e, Places Been), I thought to myself, then what about an 
app that instead of keeping tracks of countries I have been to, it would store fantasy worlds that I
used to experience? Like Harry Potter World, The Hobbit World, Adventure Time World?

## Details

**What will the application do?**
- Stores fantasy worlds in categories including *cartoon, movies, books, games*
- Users can 'unlock'/open a world if they experienced that world (from books, movies, etc)
- Keep tracks of the worlds users have been to
- List the worlds users been to in 

**Target users:** anyone who is a big fan of fantasy books, fantasy movies, who are obsessed with 
fantasy worlds (Potterheads, Alice in Wonderland fans, etc...)

**Why this project?**
- Because I like different worlds in fantasy books
- Because fantasy and traveling is fun!! I want to combine my two interests for this project
- COVID is going to prevent people from traveling, so let's 'travel' through pages and movies!
- I'm learning to create an application with a topic I really like!
